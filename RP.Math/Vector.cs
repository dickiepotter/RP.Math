    /// Square components method was pointing to the square root static method
    /// Added comments about meaning of comparison operations on two vectors
    /// Changed references to degrees to radians
    /// Changed the implementation of Angle to help avoid NaN results
    /// The Vector class is now immutable, property setters have been removed and mutable methods return a new Vector
    /// Updated comments to read better under intellisense.
    /// Added Projection, Rejection and Reflection operations
    /// Split up operations into regions
    /// Added scale operations which used to be accessable through the magnitude mutable property
    /// Changed the Equals(object) method to use Equals(Vector)
    /// Added component rounding operations
    /// Added rotate arround x, y or z (with or without axis offsets)
    /// Added Equals overloads with an absolute tolerace parameters
    /// Added IsUnitVector overloads with absolute tolerance parameters

    /// Fixed an infinity issue in the Vector.CompareTo method
    /// Unit testing proved that NaN == NaN is not the same as Nan.Equals(NaN) - Altered .Equals method to be consistent with the .Net framework
    /// Added IsNaN methods
    /// Added NormalizeOrDefault method
